Sometime in mid 2016, I wanted to publish a small book on product management 101. A friend on mine ran a print magazine for engineering students and was ready to help this mini guide published. 

Though this print project never took off, I have the topics mind mapped. Found it recently while I was looking to clean up some space on my 126GB Air during OS upgrade

I plan to do some posts for few topics noted in it. But, if you are new to product management, take a peek at this image here and Google around to learn these.  Should be a great learning.
