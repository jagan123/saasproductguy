### Freemium & Subscription
3 or 4 different pricing plans with a free plan with limited set of features or limit on usage - explained below. Anyone can signup for the product without a credit card and can upgrade once the limits are reached. Automated mails are sent to users based on the usage, nudging them to upgrade to a paid subscription plan.

Products experiment with their pricing frequently and see what sticks with them. Like having no credit card requirement for the trial period, charging $1 for the first month so you have customer’s cc on file and regular monthly subscription later on.


### Price per seat & features
The features are grouped in different buckets and pricing is charged per member according to the selected bucket/plan. All team members are usually in the same plan for this. All CRM, automation, helpdesk and most other B2B SaaS businesses follow this pricing pattern.

### Value add pricing
In this pricing pattern, in addition to the per seat & feature based pricing, there’s also a flat fixed fee for the value adding. These services could be in the form of setup/installation, phone support, additional reporting plugin etc.

### Usage based pricing
Pricing of AWS is a classic example. Everything is dynamic and configurable. Pricing depends on the usage it has. Billing down to per second of usage.

### Flat fixed fee
No matter the features or the usage patterns you have, the businesses charge a flat fee. This is also license or seat based fee. e.g: Sketch

### Dynamic & Tiered pricing
The more you use, the lesser you pay. e.g: VoIP services. The pricing also changes based on the country you are in (e.g: wesbos javascript courses)

If you have come across any more example of different pricing mechanism, I’d love to hear.
