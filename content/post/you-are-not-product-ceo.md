I lost count of the number of times people refer product managers as the CEO of their product. I have a countering argument to this. PMs are not the CEOs of the product.

PMs main objective revolves around the product and customers and not the gazillion other stuff a CEO worries about viz., raising money or hiring.  In the beginning of my career it gave me immense sense of pride to believe I was the mini CEO.  Only later when I ventured to build my own product, boy I realised how tough of a job is to be a CEO/founder.  

So, why do people call or think PMs as the CEOs? Because, by definition you are a problem solver. You are a liaison officer to unblock engineering, design, marketing, sales and support teams. 


> You are a product planner, glorified note taker, fire fighter and a chaos controller.


This is what a startup CEO does. A CEO also does more which are not part of a PMs role. You just do not have the access, grit or bandwidth to manage those functions. 

But what’s within your power, is the ability to take important product decisions.  You are hired to help the CEO meet his vision for the company and to play an active role in achieving it faster and distraction free. You decide the roadmap while the theme for the quarter/semi-annual is driven by the CEO. While the battlefield is decided and the weapons chosen, you get to strategise the war and optimally use the resources - how much of it going for the customer asks, support ticket fixes, engineering debt, sales prospect asks and your own internal feature wish-list. You own the product roadmap, envision the product, conduct market research and filter through the feedback channels for the features built. Don’t let the mini CEO tag fool you.
