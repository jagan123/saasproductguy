Last time I got asked this question, I took a brief pause to think about it to answer a friend. One of my friends was trying to understand what a PM does and what should be the #1 skill for anyone to transition into a PM role from engineering. I answered, communication and in the back of my mind was thinking this should be a blogpost instead of a one word answer.

## Communication 
— Stakeholder communication:   
Both up & down the value chain (leadership & product board)    
How do win?  Through competitor analysis, product ideation and a good go-to-market strategy.

— Inter departmental communication:   
Engineering, design, content & sales teams and across dependent group products if your feature is spanning across.   
How to win? By writing a good PRD and scribing MoMs after every meeting. 

— Communication with customers:   
On the feedback iteration, roadmap, demos and user interviews.    
How to win? By being charming with product knowledge and empathising with the users on the problems faced.   

— Storytelling:   
Be good at narrating an incident, a backstory or tie up to events or characters that the target audience relate to and empathise with. 


This also directly relates to how good we are with **negotiation**   
— In getting a buy-in from the leadership   
— New asks from customers   
— Dealing with Engineering & Sales pushback   

The next close skill is being good and strong in saying a **NO** to anyone. While you do so, remember the Amazon's leadership principle of [Disagree & Commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit)
