I’m one of those product managers who advocates that everyone in the
organisation should know to code. Being a non-MBA and coming from an engineering
background, I might be biased on that part. But I firmly do believe that
knowledge to code helps us in bringing a better product to market.

> You can trust your engineers.

If you do not trust your engineer everything can fall apart and it breeds a bad
culture of mistrust, mud sledging and what not? To trust your engineer, you need
to talk their language. There comes these — RESTful APIs, code refactoring, poor
test coverage, algorithms, performance improvements, code reviews, queuing and
such.

What better way there is to befriend your engineer than committing some time to
learn to code? Sure, you can ask your engineer friend and learn the keywords
and talk. But you’ll learn the hard way that it’s not going to help you.

> You can be better in saying *No* to the CEO and other stake holders.

You need to say No, almost always to all those fancy features that your CEO
needs for the MVP or to that optimistic product owner filling up the backlog.
While the *delta 4 value (more on this in later posts)* of the new feature can
be discussed at length with your team, ability to code helps you get a ballpark
estimate number quickly even before you work on the wireframe.

> You can be a better negotiator with your engineering, business and sales teams

Engineers will love you because you understand their work and at the same will
try to put in more effort to ship faster. Why? Because they now know how
important it is for the product to get released.

If your sales team got only one chance to call someone before they can quickly
commit on a timeline for a feature that’s already on backlog, you are going to
receive that call. Even if you fail to deliver that feature ontime, you can
always back your engineering team because #1.

That said, there’s a reason you became a product guy and not an engineer. So do
not spend time in coding. Hire someone much better than you for that.
