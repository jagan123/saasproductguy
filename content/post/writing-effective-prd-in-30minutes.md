Though I was in the SaaS product space in Hyderabad since 2011, I haven't written a PRD until 2016. Late in 2015, I appeared for an interview and flaired decently well until the last round. And then came this question in the 1:1 with the founder/ceo.

"Do you know how to write a PRD? Did you write one in your day job as a product manager?". I answered in negative. Until that point in my career, I was of the assumption that the 'agile' doesn't demand the need for the product requirement documents and 'user stories' should suffice. Boy, how wrong was I! While that interview didn't materialize in me receiving an offer letter from the company, that thought of how essential a good PRD is hit me hard and I went to gather material to write an effective PRD. In the later companies/products that I worked for it's again only in 2018 that I got a chance to follow a template and put that PRD writing into practise in the real world. The startups I worked for all through in my career were happy with my user stories in the backlog. But now I insist on PRDs as single source of truth - not your story descriptions or the jira comments sedction.
