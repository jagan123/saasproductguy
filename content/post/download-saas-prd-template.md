There are many templates and formats people follow while writing a PRD (product requirement document), based on the industry or the market their product is catering towards.  

Hereâ€™s a good article which in which Manas explains how he formulates the PRD (link at bottom). This post and the template is a little modification to the same.  

## Download this SaaS PRD template, here:
