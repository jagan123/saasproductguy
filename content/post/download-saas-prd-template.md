There are many templates and formats people follow while writing a PRD (product requirement document), based on the industry or the market their product is catering towards.  


## Download this SaaS PRD template, here:  
[SaaS PRD template - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKse3o3HtUDK_6RLQ__pdrBbgHFAd8zwwSmkUWwQlAg/edit?usp=sharing)  

The template has all the sections and placeholder texts helping you understand what each section is and how it has to be filled.  


Here’s a good article which in which Manas explains how he formulates the PRD. This post and the template is a little modification to the same.
