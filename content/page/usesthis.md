This list is inspired from [Uses This / Interviews](https://usesthis.com/) and the list at  [Mj blog](https://manassaloi.com/usesthis/) . The hardware, software, services and tools I use at work, home and hobby.


### Hardware
* Macbook Pro 2016 - Work machine given by Kony. I use this as a personal device too.
* MacBook Air 13”: Got this in 2015. Works reliably even today. I was yearning for this since my first job, but could only afford it 3 years later.
* iPhone XR: Upgraded from 5S
* iPad + Pencil: It’s fun to sketch. And the iPad is my go-to device for video content consumption. Idea is to use this as my note taking and wire framing tool with the pencil.
* Apple Airpods 2: Best purchase of 2019.  You see, I’m tied to Apple ecosystem :)
* Apple Watch series 3: I don’t see any good use with this except the calendar widget alerting me of upcoming meetings. May be I should start using the steps app
* Amazon Echo Plus: Gift
* Amazon Echo dot: Gift
* Kindle reader 2014: I do not use this as often as I wish to. VFM.


### Software   
On Mac 

* Bear Notes - for taking notes and blogposts in markdown
* Sketch - worth the $100 I spent on this. I use this to tweak / create mockups. Learnt using this tool by taking up a popular course at Udemy.
* Sublime text editor. Visual Studio Code too sometimes with heavy dose of plugins installed.
* Brave browser
* Lastpass extension - this seems buggy but I'm living with it
* Slack - Office communication + some other public workspaces (unofficed, remoteIndian, makerskitchen and InvertedPassion). I take notes in DM self during every meeting.
* Zoom - calls & meetings
* Camtasia 2018 - Video editor. I record screen using Quicktime player and edit raw screen recordings here. My office bought the license. 

On Phone

* Overcast - For podcasts. I’m actively listening during commute
* iBooks - for reading. Books synced across my Mac & iPad 
* Todoist - Started to use in 2020. So far, good.

### Investment Apps

### Domains & Tech
* Google Firebase. For all backend & side hustle experiments. Sometimes DigitalOcean / Heroku
* Domains: name.com and namecheap. I hate GoDaddy for their dark pricing practices and the amount of upselling goes during the checkout flow. Avoid. I search for domain availability at iwantmyname.com Also subscribed to park.io to get alerts of cool expiring domain names.
* Carrd.co for landing pages. $20/year
* Wix.com for a simple website. It’s cheap! - Rs30/month
* Netlify.com - that’s where this blog is hosted. Free!
* Github for all my code repos. This blog is updated and committed to a GitHub repo through which netflify picksup, builds and publishes proactively.
